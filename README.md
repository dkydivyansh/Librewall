> **The open-source, high-performance alternative to proprietary wallpaper engines.**

---

## Project Status: Coming Soon

**Librewall is currently in active pre-alpha development.**

We are building a native, cross-platform solution to bring interactive, 3D, and animated wallpapers to your desktop without the bloat or proprietary restrictions of existing software.

---

## The Vision

Most current live wallpaper solutions (like Wallpaper Engine) suffer from two main issues:
1.  **Proprietary Lock-in:** They are closed-source and paid.
2.  **Poor Linux Support:** They often require Wine, Proton, or heavy workarounds to run on Linux.

**Librewall changes this.** We are building a native engine that renders 3D scenes and animations directly on your desktop backend, ensuring minimal resource usage and maximum customization.

## Planned Features

* True Native Support: Runs natively on **Windows** and **Linux** (No Wine/emulation required).
* 3D Scene Rendering: Support for real-time 3D environments, not just looped videos.
* High Performance: Optimized to pause when full-screen applications/games are running to save resources.
* Deep Customization: Tweak lighting, physics, and animation speeds in real-time.
* 100% Open Source: Built for the community, by the community.

## Architecture (Tentative)

* **Core:** High-performance rendering engine.
* **Rendering:** GPU-accelerated graphics.
* **UI:** Modern, responsive configuration dashboard.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Core Engine Architecture Design
- [ ] Cross-Platform Window Management (Win32 / X11 / Wayland)
- [ ] Basic 2D/Video Rendering Support
- [ ] Advanced 3D Scene Implementation
- [ ] Public Alpha Release
